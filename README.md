## Workspace setup

### Note for IDEA users
If you are using CLion (or any other IDEA IDE), you should go to *Build, 
Execution, and Deployment* -> *Toolchains*, create one for this project, and 
select your cross-compiler for your target architecture. This will stop CLion
from always assuming a hosted environment.
